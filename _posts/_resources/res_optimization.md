<summary>:books: Scientific Computing with MATLAB and Octave</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [A. Quarteroni](https://cmcs.epfl.ch/people/quarteroni), [F. Saleri](http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/saleri/),[P. Gervasio](http://paola-gervasio.unibs.it/).
+ Review : Good book which is very well structured to read all at once. Although it is mostly focused on application of numerical methods, it still keeps a good mathematical rigor. Although the initial chapters aren't very math-heavy, you should have good understanding of analysis to really enjoy mthe very interesting final chapters.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Book for people who have a descent understanding of analysis and want to start applying these concepts to more practical problems.
    * Complement to a numerical analysis course, to improve your understanding and start coding.
    * Self-paced book for young applied mathematicians/engineers who would like to learn MATLAB while understanding the power of numerical tools.
+ Notes : Prof. Quarteroni was my first professor of a class linking math and computer science. His course was probably my favorite at EPFL and he always had great examples of how he applied some methods to a variety of different domains.
+ Level : Intermediate.

<summary>:books: A First Course in Numerical Methods</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [U. Ascher](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ascher/), [C. Greif](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~greif/).
+ Review : Relatively good book for an introduction to numerical methods. I really enjoy the comments you will find in colored boxed. It is written pretty informally both in language and mathematical rigor, and is more focused on application with little proofs/derivations. Although it does a good job covering many different topics it doesn't go enough into details and thus can be hard to understand. Overall good book if you know what you are doing.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Book if you already had an introduction class on numerical methods long time ago and would like to refresh all the topics you had covered, as well a their applications. 
    * Complement to a numerical analysis course.
+ Level : Intermediate.

<summary>:mortar_board: CMU - Convex Optimization </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [Javier Pe√±a](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jfp/), [Ryan Tibshirani](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/)
+ Review : Very good class covering optimization while keeping in mind applications to machine learning. Both professors do a very good job to give mathematical intuition of the important concepts and algorithms in covex optimization. The class is focused on computational and numerical methods, so you don't have much real proofs. You definitely not need to know about ML to watch it but if you might get more ideas about how to use these concepts in practice. You should have good linear algebra knowledge.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course for anyone who knows about basic machine learning but not much about optimization which is essential in ML.
    * Introductory class to convex optimization.
+ Level : Intermediate.
