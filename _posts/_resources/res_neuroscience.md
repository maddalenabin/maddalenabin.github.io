<summary>:movie_camera: EPFL - Neuronal Dynamics </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [W. Gerstner](http://lcn.epfl.ch/~gerstner/).
+ Review : Excellent class where to learn how to mathematically / physically model a single neuron. Prof Gerstner is extremely clear and has a very good mathematical rigor. He gives very good intuition of the mathematical ways of describing bio-chemical processes. You should have some good calculus background, and it could be helpful to have some basic knowledge of physics / chemistry.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course if you have a good mathematical background and are interested in "understanding the brain".
    * Course if you come from machine learning and would like to know how ANN differ from current mathematical models of neurons.
+ Notes : I currently only have watched $\frac{2}{7}$ of the course, I definitely plan on finishing it but didn't have time yet. So my review might change afterwards. 
+ Level : Intermediate - Advanced.
