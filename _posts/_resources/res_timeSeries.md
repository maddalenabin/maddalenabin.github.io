<summary>:books: Forecasting: principles and practice</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [R. Hyndman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_J._Hyndman), [G. Athanasopoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qvkaib8AAAAJ&hl=en) .
+ Review : Very good basic introduction about time series forecasting. Easy and quick to read with simple language. Focuses on practice with many examples in R. Little math involved.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Introductory self-studying book giving you a good overview of the most import time series notions.
    * "Documentation" if you plan on using the R package [forecast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf), as R. Hyndman is one of the main author of both. It gives you enough theory behind the package to use it sensibly and productively.
+ Notes : A lot of the Time Series resources are from R. Hyndman, so it's nice to use the same notation as him.

<summary>:books: Introduction to Time Series Forecasting With Python</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [J. Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/).
+ Review : Good basic introduction. Mostly focused on practical examples and Python code. No math involved. I personally find that there isn't enough theoretical explanations and math involved, but it was definitely not the goal of the book.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Self-study book if you want to start coding as soon as possible.
    * Self-study book if you only speak in python but not in math.
+ Notes : J. Brownlee is the author of the famous [machine learning mastery blog](machinelearningmastery.com), this book is basically copy pasted from his posts.
