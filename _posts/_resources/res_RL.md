<summary>:mortar_board: OpenAI/BAIR - Deep Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [DeepRlBootcamp team](https://www.deepbootcamp.io/).
+ Review : Very good classes that cover many aspects of deep reinforcement learning. The lecturers are some of the most famous deep RL researchers. You probably should have some understanding of RL before watching these if you want to take full advantage of the content.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand-alone videos when you are interested about a specific topic / method.
* Notes : I participated to the bootcamp, so you might even hear a question from me :sweat_smile:. it was an amazing opportunity and I would recommend to anyone who is even slightly in the field.
+ Level : Advanced - "Expert" (maybe for lecture 5).
