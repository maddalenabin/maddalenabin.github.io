<summary>:mortar_board: Stanford - CS224n : Natural Language processing with deep learning</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [C. Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/), [R. Socher](http://www.socher.org/)
+ Review : Excellent class for understanding state of the art NLP methods. As the name of the class suggests, it talks very little in "older" NLP methods, it focuses on deep learning and the use of the "newer" word embeddings (~2013). You should probably have some machine learning knowledge to take ful advantage of the class.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course to effectively apply and understand state-of-the art NLP methods.
+ Notes : Probably the most famous state-of-the art NLP class (in 2017). The NLP version of the other famous Stanford class : CS231n. I watched the older version but I think that the review still holds (even though 2 courses merged in this one).
+ Level : Intermediate-Advanced.

<summary>:movie_camera: Coursera - Natural Language Processing </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [M. Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/).
+ Review : Excellent MOOC which gives you a in depth view of the major algorithms which were done in NLP before the "deep-learning era". I've rarely seen a professor keeping such a level of clarity during the whole course.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course if you are starting in NLP but are serious about continuing.
    * Course if you have applied deep learning to NLP, but would like to really understand this very interesting field.
+ Notes : Unfortunately not given on Coursera anymore. I understand that giving such a class must take a huge amount of time, but I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't put the old videos on youtube. Thankfully, you can still find someone who put the videos up.
+ Level : Beginner-Intermediate.

+ Review : Very good NLP podcast where the 2 research scientists discuss about a new paper in the field or interview other scientists about their recent work. Great way to keep up with the research in the field of NLP! The only downside with this podcast compared to the more general ones is that I find it hard to multi-task while listening to it.
+ Recommend as : 
    * PoPodcast to keep up with the recent papers and research in the field of NLP.
+ Level : Advanced-Expert.
