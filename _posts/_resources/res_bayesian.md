<summary>:books: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [C. Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/), [C. Williams](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/)
+ Review : Very good concise book that perfectly balances the amount of math to lay a formal foundation in Gaussian Processes (GP) for ML, while still being easy to follow. A must read for anyone interested in GP. The provided code turned into a easy to use Matlab toolbox ([GPML](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/)). 
+ Recommend as : 
    * Introductory book to Gaussian Processes (chapters 1-5).
    * Preparation for GP research and advance use-cases (chapters 6-9).
    * Reference for GP.
+ Notes : Fortunately, Prof. Rasmussen teaches a few of my classes at Cambridge U., he really has a gift to explain complicated topics in easy terms.
+ Level : Intermediate - Advanced.

+ Price : Free HTML version, ~40$ hardcover.

<summary>:movie_camera: NIPS 2016 - Bayesian Deep Learning Workshop</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : multiple.
+ Review : Good videos of the workshop. Being able to listen to many of the best researchers in this quickly growing field is very interesting. Unfortunate the videos are too short to really be able to cover the subject with great depth.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand alone videos for anyone interested in Bayesian Deep Learning (should have some knowledge of ML and DL).
+ Level : Intermediate-Advanced.
