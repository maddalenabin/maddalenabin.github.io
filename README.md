This is a Github Pages template for academic websites. It is inspired by [Yann Dubs' repo](https://github.com/YannDubs/YannDubs.github.io), based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I've edited it a little bit to suit my needs. It is still a work in progress and will be improved with time. The esthetics is not what I want, but that needs time :) 

The website can be found at the link [maddalenabin.github.io/](https://maddalenabin.github.io/).
