Iâ€™m a physicist with a PhD from Stockholm University, where I studied protein systems using X-ray scattering techniques.

Currently, Iâ€™m shifting focus toward machine learning and AI, with a strong interest in building clean, high-quality datasets and applying statistical methods to real-world problems. I enjoy working at the intersection of science, data, and storytelling.
