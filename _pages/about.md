Hello!

I'm a researcher at OpenAI.
Previously, I was a PhD student in machine learning at Stanford University co-advised by [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/) and funded by a [Knights-Hennessy Scholarship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/).
Before that I traveled around and did some research at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) did my AI residency at [Facebook AI](https://research.fb.com/programs/facebook-ai-residency-program/), and worked in different startups including [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)) where I was designing algorithms to analyze text in under-research languages (Thai, Khmer, Burmese, ...) before LLMs were a thing.

Outside of machine learning I spend my time exercising with friends (:ski:,:mountain:,:badminton:,:volleyball:,:runner:), traveling, or reading about geopolitics.

<!-- News
