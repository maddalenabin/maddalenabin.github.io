🛠️🚧 Work in progress 🛠️🚧

Hello!

I'm starting my journey to become a data scientist with expertise in ML/AI. I was a PhD student in Chemical Physics at Stockholm University, in the [SDAQS](https://sdaqs.fysik.su.se/index.html) group led by [Fivos Perakis](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/fpera-1.260748). 

Outside of work, I spend my time doing all sorts of sports, expanding my horizons through cultural activities, and [traveling](https://www.polarsteps.com/MaddalenaBin/16318381-post-phd-trip?s=181e0c8b-df65-4d8f-a01f-487f6ed32d42). I also have a strong interest in maps.
