This is definitely my favorite mountain activity!

Big thanks to my guide, [Gianluca Bellin](https://www.gianlucabellin.it/). If you're heading to the Dolomites in northeastern Italy, I highly recommend getting in touch with him. He offers canyoning, via ferrata, hiking, ski mountaineering, rock climbing, and much more.

We made two YouTube videos:
